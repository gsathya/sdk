## 1.12.0

### Core library changes

* `dart:convert`
  * `LineSplitter` added a `split` static method returning an `Iterable`.

* `dart:html`
  * `NodeTreeSanitizer` added the `const trusted` field. It can be used
    instead of defining a `NullTreeSanitizer` class when calling
    `setInnerHtml` or other methods that create DOM from text. It is
    also more efficient, skipping the creation of a `DocumentFragment`.

* `dart:io`
  * Added two new file modes, `WRITE_ONLY` and `WRITE_ONLY_APPEND` for
    opening a file write only.

  * Change stdout/stderr to binary mode on Windows.

### Tool changes

* Pub

  * `pub run` starts up faster for executables that don't import transformed
    code.

  * `pub get` and `pub upgrade`

    * Pub will now generate a ".packages" file in addition to the "packages"
      directory when running `pub get` or similar operations, per the
      [package spec proposal][]. Pub now has a `--no-package-symlinks` flag that
      will stop "packages" directories from being generated at all.

    * An issue where HTTP requests were sometimes made even though `--offline`
      was passed has been fixed.

    * A bug with `--offline` that caused an unhelpful error message has been
      fixed.

    * Pub will no longer time out when a package takes a long time to download.

  * `pub publish`

    * Pub will emit a non-zero exit code when it finds a violation while
      publishing.

    * `.gitignore` files will be respected even if the package isn't at the top
      level of the Git repository.

  * Barback integration

    * A crashing bug involving transformers that only apply to non-public code
      has been fixed.

    * A stack overflow caused by a transformer being run multiple times on the
      package that defines it has been fixed.

## 1.11.2

### Core library changes

* Fix a bug where `WebSocket.close()` would crash if called after
  `WebSocket.cancel()`.

## 1.11.1

### Tool changes

* Pub will always load Dart SDK assets from the SDK whose `pub` executable was
  run, even if a `DART_SDK` environment variable is set.

  * `Map` added an `unmodifiable` constructor.
  * `int` added a `gcd` method.

  * List iterators may not throw `ConcurrentModificationError` as eagerly in
    release mode. In checked mode, the modification check is still as eager
    as possible.

* `dart:html`
  * `Element` methods, `appendHtml` and `insertAdjacentHtml` now take `nodeValidator`
    and `treeSanitizer` parameters, and the inputs are consistently
    sanitized.
    [r45818 announcement](https://groups.google.com/a/dartlang.org/forum/#!topic/announce/GVO7EAcPi6A)

* `dart:isolate`
  * **BREAKING** The positional `priority` parameter of `Isolate.ping` and `Isolate.kill` is
    now a named parameter named `priority`.
  * **BREAKING** Removed the `Isolate.AS_EVENT` priority.
  * `Isolate` methods `ping` and `addOnExitListener` now have a named parameter
    `response`.
    [r45092](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/commit/1b208bd)
  * `Isolate.spawnUri` added a named argument `checked`.
* `dart:profiler` - **DEPRECATED**
  * This library will be removed in 1.12. Use `dart:developer` instead.

* This is the first release that does not include the Eclipse-based
  **Dart Editor**.
